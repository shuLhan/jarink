= Jarink

Jarink is a program to help web administrator and developers to inspect
and maintains their website.

== Synopsis

        jarink [OPTIONS] <COMMAND> <args...>

Available command,

        brokenlinks - scan the website for broken links (page and images).
        help        - print the usage of the command.

== Usage

[OPTIONS] brokenlinks <URL>

        Scan for broken links on the web server pointed by URL.
        Links will be scanned on anchor href attribute ("<a href=...>") or
        on the image src attribute ("<img src=...").

        The URL can be start from base or from sub path.
        Scanning from path only report brokenlinks on that path and their
        sub paths.

        Once finished it will print the page and list of broken links in
        JSON format to standard output,

                {
                        "$PAGE": [{
                                "link": <string>,
                                "error": <string>,
                                "code": <integer>
                        },
                        ...
                        ],
                        ...
                }

        This command accept the following options,

        -verbose

                Print the page that being scanned to standard error.

        -past-result=<path to JSON file>

                Scan only the pages reported by result from past scan based
                on the content in JSON file. This minimize the time to
                re-scan the pages once we have fixed the URLs.

        For example, given a website that have the following pages,

                - web.tld (base)
                - web.tld/page1
                - web.tld/page1/sub1
                - web.tld/page2
                - web.tld/page2/sub1

        Invoking brokenlinks with

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld

        will scan all of the pages, but invoking brokenlinks on path
        "/page2"

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld/page2

        only scan "/page2" and "/page2/sub1".
