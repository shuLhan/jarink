                - web.tld/page2
                - web.tld/page2/sub1

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld

        will scan all of the pages, but invoking brokenlinks on path
        "/page2"

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld/page2

        only scan "/page2" and "/page2/sub1".

        JSON format to standard output,

                {
                        "$PAGE": [{
                                "Link": <string>,
                                "Error": <string>,
                                "Code": <integer>
                        },
                        ...
                        ],
