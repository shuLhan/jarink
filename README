                - web.tld/page2
                - web.tld/page2/sub1

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld

        will scan all of the pages, but invoking brokenlinks on path
        "/page2"

                $ jarink brokenlinks https://web.tld/page2

        only scan "/page2" and "/page2/sub1".

        Once finished it will print the page and list of broken links in
        JSON format to standard output,

                {
                        "$PAGE": [{
                                "link": <string>,
                                "error": <string>,
                                "code": <integer>
                        },
                        ...
                        ],
